# Tile.NET: A simple .NET API for Tile® Bluetooth trackers

Tile.NET is a simple .NET library for retrieving information on [Tile® Bluetooth trackers](https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/) (including last location and more).

This library is built on an unpublished, unofficial Tile API; it may alter or cease operation at any point.

The code is ported (copy pasted) from the python library [pytile](https://github.com/bachya/pytile).
